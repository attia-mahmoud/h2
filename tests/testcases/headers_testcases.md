133. "Trailers MUST NOT include pseudo-header fields (Section 8.3)."
140. "Field names MUST be converted to lowercase when constructing an HTTP/2 message."
141. "A field name MUST NOT contain characters in the ranges 0x00-0x20, 0x41-0x5a, or 0x7f-0xff (all ranges inclusive). This specifically excludes all non-visible ASCII characters, ASCII SP (0x20), and uppercase characters ('A' to 'Z', ASCII 0x41 to 0x5a)."
142. "With the exception of pseudo-header fields (Section 8.3), which have a name that starts with a single colon, field names MUST NOT include a colon (ASCII COLON, 0x3a)."
143. "A field value MUST NOT contain the zero value (ASCII NUL, 0x00), line feed (ASCII LF, 0x0a), or carriage return (ASCII CR, 0x0d) at any position."
144. "A field value MUST NOT start or end with an ASCII whitespace character (ASCII SP or HTAB, 0x20 or 0x09)."
147. "An endpoint MUST NOT generate an HTTP/2 message containing connection-specific header fields. This includes the Connection header field and those listed as having connection-specific semantics in Section 7.6.1 of [HTTP] (that is, Proxy-Connection, Keep-Alive, Transfer-Encoding, and Upgrade). Any message containing connection-specific header fields MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.1)."
148. "The only exception to this is the TE header field, which MAY be present in an HTTP/2 request; when it is, it MUST NOT contain any value other than "trailers"."
150. "The Cookie header field MUST NOT be compressed."
151. "If there are multiple Cookie header fields after decompression, these MUST be concatenated into a single octet string using the two-octet delimiter of 0x3b, 0x20 (the ASCII string "; ") before being passed into a non-HTTP/2 context, such as an HTTP/1.1 connection, or a generic HTTP server application."
152. "Pseudo-header fields are not HTTP header fields. Endpoints MUST NOT generate pseudo-header fields other than those defined in this document."
153. "Pseudo-header fields defined for requests MUST NOT appear in responses."
154. "Pseudo-header fields defined for responses MUST NOT appear in requests."
155. "Pseudo-header fields MUST NOT appear in a trailer section."
156. "Endpoints MUST treat a request or response that contains undefined or invalid pseudo-header fields as malformed (Section 8.1.1)."
157. "All pseudo-header fields MUST appear in a field block before all regular field lines. Any request or response that contains a pseudo-header field that appears in a field block after a regular field line MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.1)."
158. "The same pseudo-header field name MUST NOT appear more than once in a field block. A field block for an HTTP request or response that contains a repeated pseudo-header field name MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.1)."
159. "The ":authority" pseudo-header field conveys the authority portion (Section 3.2 of [RFC3986]) of the target URI (Section 7.1 of [HTTP]). The recipient of an HTTP/2 request MUST NOT use the Host header field to determine the target URI if ":authority" is present."
160. "Clients that generate HTTP/2 requests directly MUST use the ":authority" pseudo-header field to convey authority information, unless there is no authority information to convey (in which case it MUST NOT generate ":authority")."
161. "Clients MUST NOT generate a request with a Host header field that differs from the ":authority" pseudo-header field."
163. "An intermediary that forwards a request over HTTP/2 MUST construct an ":authority" pseudo-header field using the authority information from the control data of the original request, unless the original request's target URI does not contain authority information (in which case it MUST NOT generate ":authority")."
164. "An intermediary that needs to generate a Host header field (which might be necessary to construct an HTTP/1.1 request) MUST use the value from the ":authority" pseudo-header field as the value of the Host field, unless the intermediary also changes the request target. This replaces any existing Host field to avoid potential vulnerabilities in HTTP routing."
165. "':authority' MUST NOT include the deprecated userinfo subcomponent for "http" or "https" schemed URIs."
166. "The ":path" pseudo-header field conveys the path portion (Section 3.3 of [RFC3986]) of the target URI (Section 7.1 of [HTTP]). This pseudo-header field MUST NOT be empty for "http" or "https" URIs; "http" or "https" URIs that do not contain a path component MUST include a value of '/'. The exceptions to this rule are: an OPTIONS request for an "http" or "https" URI that does not include a path component; these MUST include a ":path" pseudo-header field with a value of '*' (see Section 7.1 of [HTTP])."
167. "All HTTP/2 requests MUST include exactly one valid value for the ":method", ":scheme", and ":path" pseudo-header fields, unless they are CONNECT requests (Section 8.5). An HTTP request that omits mandatory pseudo-header fields is malformed (Section 8.1.1)."
168. "For HTTP/2 responses, a single ":status" pseudo-header field is defined that carries the HTTP status code field (see Section 15 of [HTTP]). This pseudo-header field MUST be included in all responses, including interim responses; otherwise, the response is malformed (Section 8.1.1)."
181. "The ":scheme" and ":path" pseudo-header fields MUST be omitted."
