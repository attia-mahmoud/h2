15. "Field blocks MUST be transmitted as a contiguous sequence of frames, with no interleaved frames of any other type or from any other stream."
16. "A receiver terminate the connection with a MUST connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type COMPRESSION_ERROR if it does not decompress a field block."
17. "A decoding error in a field block MUST be treated as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type COMPRESSION_ERROR."
18. "Once an endpoint acknowledges a change to SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE that reduces the maximum below the current size of the dynamic table, its HPACK encoder MUST start the next field block with a Dynamic Table Size Update instruction that sets the dynamic table to a size that is less than or equal to the reduced maximum."
19. "An endpoint MUST treat a field block that follows an acknowledgment of the reduction to the maximum dynamic table size as a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type COMPRESSION_ERROR if it does not start with a conformant Dynamic Table Size Update instruction."
111. "For instance, HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE, and CONTINUATION frames MUST be minimally processed to ensure that the state maintained for field section compression is consistent (see Section 4.3); similarly, DATA frames MUST be counted toward the connection flow-control window."
150. "The Cookie header field MUST NOT be compressed."
151. "If there are multiple Cookie header fields after decompression, these MUST be concatenated into a single octet string using the two-octet delimiter of 0x3b, 0x20 (the ASCII string "; ") before being passed into a non-HTTP/2 context, such as an HTTP/1.1 connection, or a generic HTTP server application."
191. "A deployment of HTTP/2 over TLS 1.2 MUST disable compression."
206. "Implementations communicating on a secure channel MUST NOT compress content that includes both confidential and attacker-controlled data unless separate compression dictionaries are used for each source of data."
207. "Compression MUST NOT be used if the source of data cannot be reliably determined."
208. "Generic stream compression, such as that provided by TLS, MUST NOT be used with HTTP/2 (see Section 9.2)."
