115. "WINDOW_UPDATE can be sent by a peer that has sent a frame with the END_STREAM flag set. This means that a receiver could receive a WINDOW_UPDATE frame on a stream in a "half-closed (remote)" or "closed" state. A receiver MUST NOT treat this as an error (see Section 5.1)."

183. "A TCP connection error is signaled with RST_STREAM. A proxy treats any error in the TCP connection, which includes receiving a TCP segment with the RST bit set, as a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of type CONNECT_ERROR. Correspondingly, a proxy MUST send a TCP segment with the RST bit set if it detects an error with the stream or the HTTP/2 connection."
185. "A server MUST NOT indicate that a stream has not been processed unless it can guarantee that fact."
186. "If frames that are on a stream are passed to the application layer for any stream, then REFUSED_STREAM MUST NOT be used for that stream, and a GOAWAY frame MUST include a stream identifier that is greater than or equal to the given stream identifier."
208. "Generic stream compression, such as that provided by TLS, MUST NOT be used with HTTP/2 (see Section 9.2)."
